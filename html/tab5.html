    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis4Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis4Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
            </li>
          <p>  the line is increased
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
              
            </li>
          <p>red dots are far from linear regression<br />
             are quite close to the regression line
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;"> 
              Estimate how many energy you will consume in the next month. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
            </li>
          <p>79.6
        </p>
            <li style="font-weight: bold;">
               A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or remain stable the consumption of electric energy.
              </li>
            <p>The level of energy consumed in my house is quite good considering<br />
               that we are two people, the average is 100 to 200 khw per month, to maintain <br />
               a stable consumption it is necessary to take into account which electrical appliances<br />
                consume the most energy and if they are really necessary.<br />
                We must be aware of the energy we use and assess whether it is a responsible consumption.
          </p>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis4Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis4Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          The increasement and decreasement of the regression.
        </li>
      <p> The regression line increases
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">The relation among the dots regarding the colors.
        </li>
      <p>The red dots are close to each other but only two are quite close to the regression line 
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.
        </li>
      <p>17,328.72   
    </p>
         <li style="font-weight: bold;">
          A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.
        </li>
      <p> the projection at the general level of the respondents is quite good taking into account the number of people with whom they live, their level will be constant.
